# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis project was to examine Amazon's paid Vine program. This program allows companies to pay a fee to Amazon in order to provide their products to Amazon's Vine members. These members are then tasked with publishing a review of their product.

- Total Reviews
    - Vine (paid): 47
    - Non-Vine (unpaid): 8326
- 5 Star Reviews
    - Vine (paid): 15
    - Non-Vine (unpaid): 4321
- Percentage of 5 Star Reviews
    - Vine (paid): 32%
    - Non-Vine (unpaid): 52%

## Summary

It appears from the above observations that there is no bias. The amount of Vine (paid) reviews is very small compared to the Non-Vine (unpaid) reviews and the percentage of 5 star reviews is much smaller than the Non-Vine (unpaid reviews.) Additional analysis should be explored though in order to obtain more clarity as to whether or not there is bias. One other aspect that should be examined would be to determine of the 5 Star Vine (paid) reviews, how many of them were actually verified purchases. This would shine a light on whether or not these Vine members are reviewing products favorable that are not even verified purchases.
